# Data-augmentation
Data Augmentation- generation, visualization and expansion and store augmentd images into local disk


A small script to generate augmented images. Actually implemented for binary classification but can be extended for
multiclass classification too.
It reads images of 'class0' from 'database' folder, augmented it and save each augmented image in 'class0' of 'augmented_database' folder.
